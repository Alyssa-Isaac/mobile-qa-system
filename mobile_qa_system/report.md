# Mobile QA System – Project Report

This repository contains a minimal Android UI automation agent built using Python and ADB.

## Design Rationale

A full design rationale, architecture explanation, and early demo are documented in:

📄 `Framework Analysis and Video.pdf`

This document explains:
- Why Python and ADB were chosen
- The supervisor–executor architecture
- Tradeoffs between visual vs UI-hierarchy verification

## Implemented Tasks

- Task 01: UI Hierarchy Capture  
  See `results/task_01_ui_hierarchy/`

- Task 02: Open Gmail  
  See `results/open_gmail/`
This structure separates architectural reasoning from task execution, enabling scalable extension to additional Android UI tasks.
